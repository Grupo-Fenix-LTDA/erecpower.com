				<h2 class="main-title mb-2">Cancel Order</h2>
				<div class="div-content">
					<p>Due to high order volume a customer's order goes directly into our fulfillment center to be processed. If the customer contacts within 24 hours after they purchased they can cancel their order. If the customer contacts after 24 hours of purchase time then they will not be able to cancel their order. If your order is already processed or has already shipped, we cannot cancel the order. Customers will need to either refuse the package and immediately notify <a href="mail:support@support@erecpower.com"><span><span class="__cf_email__">support@erecpower.com</span></span></a> the date it was refused or return the package with a valid tracking number and notify us with said tracking number so we can verify. Once we receive the package back to our warehouse and review we will be able to provide a refund.</p>

				<h2 class="main-title mb-2">Wrong Address Disclaimer</h2>
				<div class="div-content">
					<p>It is the responsibility of the buyer to make sure that he or she enters the address correctly. We cannot guarantee address changes due to strict shipping schedules. Please double-check the address you are entering, as we will NOT be held responsible for packages that are sent to the wrong address that the buyer has entered. If your order is already processed or has already shipped, we cannot change the address and the only thing we can do is wait to see if the package gets returned back to us. In that case, we will be able to provide you with a re-ship or refund.</p>
